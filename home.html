<h1>Welcome to the Recruitment Marketplace</h1>
<p>This prototype connects candidates with recruiters on a modern,
  privacy‑aware platform. Candidates can store and share verified
  documents and credentials, browse job postings, and communicate directly
  with recruiters. Recruiters can publish job openings, discover
  qualified candidates, and manage communications.</p>
